## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "I don't have video editing software"

**Solutions**:
- Windows: Use free OBS Studio + Windows Photos app
- Mac: Use iMovie (built-in)
- Linux: Use Kdenlive or OpenShot (free)
- Online: Use free tools like Clipchamp.com or Kapwing.com

### Issue: "My video is too long"

**Solution**: Edit down to 2-2.5 minutes (feature overview, not full walkthrough)

### Issue: "I can't get good audio"

**Solution**: Record video with system audio first, then add voiceover separately

### Issue: "My internet is slow for upload"

**Solution**: Upload earlier (Thursday night) instead of Sunday. YouTube upload takes time.

### Issue: "I forgot about the demo video"

**Solution**: Can create simple 2-minute video even with phone camera. Quality matters less than content showing Gemini working.

## 🎯 Final Reminders

1. **Don't Procrastinate** - Start video recording today/tomorrow
2. **Don't Wait Until Last Day** - Submit early Sunday, not 4:59 PM
3. **Don't Change Project** - Your GeminiCRM is excellent
4. **Don't Stress** - You're 95% ready, just need video + form
5. **Do Submit** - The difference between trying and not trying is submitting
